    Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you click Online Video,<br> you can paste in the
    embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to<br> search online for the video that best
    fits your document.
    To make your document look<br> professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text box
    designs that<br> complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar.<br>
    Click
    Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.
    Themes and<br> styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new<br> Theme,
    the
    pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme.<br> When you apply styles, your headings
    change to match the new theme.
    <br>Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and<br> focus on the
    text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end,<br> Word remembers where you left off - even on
    another device. <br> <br>
