    <p> <h3>Prevention of the Coronavirus disease</h3>
        Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions.
        <br>Follow advice provided by your local health authority.<br>
        Check with your local health authority for the most relevant guidance for your region.<br>
        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:<br><br>
        - Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.<br>
        - Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.<br>
        - Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.<br>
        - Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.<br>
        - Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.<br>
        - Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.<br>
        - Stay home if you feel unwell.<br>
        - If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.<br>
        Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility.<br>
        This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
        <br><br><h3>Masks:</h3><br>
        Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing<br>
         the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined <br>
         with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
